AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Based on customers.csv analysis:

SEGMENT 1: High-Engagement Users
- Criteria: Engagement score ≥ 85 AND previous purchases ≥ 3
- Members: 021bim002@sxc.edu.np (85 score, 3 purchases)
           021bim013@sxc.edu.np (92 score, 5 purchases)
           021bim061@sxc.edu.np (88 score, 4 purchases)
- Strategy: Premium offers, early access to sales, loyalty rewards

SEGMENT 2: Low-Engagement/New Users
